Foreign Gifts to Colleges
=========================

Gifts for foreign persons and institutions to American colleges. This data comes from gift and contract reports to the U.S. Department of Education. To download the data yourself, visit <a target="_blank" href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/about/data-center/school">Federal Student Aid Data Center</a> and download from the table from "Foreign Gifts Report."

In 2003 just 10 American colleges reported to the Department of Education that they had received donations from abroad. In 2012, that number was 34, down from a peak of 50 colleges in 2011. From 2003 to 2012, alumni, corporations, governments, philanthropists, parents, and foundations donated $2.05-billion to American colleges from overseas.

Included in this repository:
- A master file of all monetary gifts and contracts going back to the 1980s.
- A table of colleges which have received monetary gifts between '03-'12, the collective value of those gifts, as well as adjustments for inflation.
- A table of countries where monetary gifts to colleges originated from. The table also includes the collective value of those gifts, as well as adjustments for inflation.
